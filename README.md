# Katharina Duecker, MSc

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Birmingham, UK, working under supervision of Prof Ole Jensen and Prof Kim Shapiro.
My scientific work lies on the intersect of cognitive and computational neuroscience and Machine Learning. 
I am passionate about uncovering how the temporal dynamics of the early visual system implement visual attention and perception.


## Repositories

### /posters
contains posters presented at conferences after May 2022.

### /CV 
resumee updated in August 2022.

### /dnn-osci 
contains Python scripts implementing a simple neural network that embraces the temporal dynamics of the visual system. These scripts are work in progress and updated irregularly

### /vs-rft
contains scripts for MEG pre-processing and coherence analysis for a Visual Search project. Again, these scripts are very much work in progress.

### /gamma-flicker-entrainment-scripts 
contains MATLAB scripts that I wrote to analyze MEG data for a project investigating synchronization between endogenous neuronal oscillations and a rapid (invisible) photic drive. [Duecker et al, 2021, J Neurosci](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/31/6684)
