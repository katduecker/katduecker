I'm Katharina Duecker, a PhD candidate at the University of Birmingham, UK. My scientific work focuses on the intersect of cognitive neuroscience 
and Machine Learning. I am passionate about uncovering how the temporal dynamics of the early visual system implement visual attention and perception.

/dnn-osci 
contains Python scripts implementing a simple neural network that embraces the temporal dynamics of the visual system.
These scripts are work in progress.

/vs-rft
contains scripts for MEG pre-processing and coherence analysis for a Visual Search project. Again, these scripts are very much 
work in progress!

/gamma-flicker-entrainment-scripts 
contains MATLAB scripts that I wrote to analyze MEG data for a project investigating the ability of a 
rapid photic drive to synchronize ongoing oscillations. 
/ent-jns-reviews 
contains the manuscript files for the respective project. Please see https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/31/6684 for the published paper.
